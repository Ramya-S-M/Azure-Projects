Azure RBAC Access Control Demo

This is a hands-on project to demonstrate **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** in Microsoft Azure by assigning the **Reader** role to a test user at the **Resource Group** scope.

---

## ðŸ”§ Project Objective

Grant **read-only access** to a test user on a specific Azure Resource Group using RBAC.

---

## Steps Performed

1. Created Test User
   - Microsoft Entra ID â†’ Users â†’ "testuser1"

2. Created Resource Group
   - Name: "rg-rbac-demo"

3. Assigned Reader Role to the User  
   - Scope: Resource Group  
   - Role: Reader

4. Logged in as Test User  
   - Verified access: Can only view resources  
   - Cannot create/delete/edit  
   - Completed MFA setup using Microsoft Authenticator

## ðŸ”’ Key Learnings

- RBAC is enforced by scope: MG > Sub > RG > Resource  
- Reader role provides view-only access  
- MFA may be enforced by default (security defaults)  
- Azure IAM is crucial for access control and security
