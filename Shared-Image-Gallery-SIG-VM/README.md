# üñ•Ô∏è Deploy Azure VM Using Shared Image Gallery (SIG)

This project demonstrates how to create a reusable VM image and distribute it across regions using **Azure Shared Image Gallery (SIG)**.

It helps in deploying consistent VM configurations at scale, useful in enterprise environments and Dev/Test setups.

## üìå Project 1: Deploy Azure VM with Shared Image Gallery

This project demonstrates how to create and manage Azure Virtual Machines using a Shared Image Gallery (SIG) for standardized, scalable image distribution across regions.

1. Created a Generalized VM to capture a custom image.

2. Created an Image Definition and Image Version inside a Shared Image Gallery.

3. Deployed a new VM using that Shared Image version.

4. Ensured versioning, scalability, and regional replication for faster and consistent VM deployments.

###This setup helps in managing golden images for your organization and supports large-scale VM deployments using pre-approved configurations.

## Step 1: Base VM Created
